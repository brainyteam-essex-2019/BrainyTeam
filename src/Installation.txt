To be able to run all the code seamlessly, the user needs to install the latest version of Python.
See Python installation instructions here: https://realpython.com/installing-python/ 

After installing the Python environment, the following libraries must be installed.
We recommend using the Pip installer in the user terminal:
NumPy: python -m pip install numpy
SciPy: python -m pip install scipy
MatPlotLib: python -m pip install matplotlib
MNE: python -m pip install mne
Scikit Learn: python -m pip install scikit-learn
Pandas: python -m pip install pandas

After these instructions are followed, add the source files to your project folder. 
The programs should work seamlessly if the dependencies were correctly installed.
